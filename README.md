# singll
A [singly linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list#Singly_linked_list) written while going through the book [Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/).

Aside from standard `push` and `pop`, it allows mutable and immutable iterations, as well as getting the head and tail of the list either mutably or immutably.

For more details, clone the repo and run `cargo doc --open` from the root of the project to generate the documentation.

You can also run associated unit tests with `cargo test`.
